Simple Pure Java 3D Engine

For educational purposes and for fun, I made this simple yet interesting project to try first hand the beauty of 3d graphics.

As the description suggests, this project does not depend on any third party library, nor it uses hardware acceleration, except maybe when the image buffer is painted on screen.
