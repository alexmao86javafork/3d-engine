 * Interface Transformable is implemented in all graphic objects, from Vertex,
 * Segment, Triangle and all 3D object classes creating a family hierarchy where
 * every object is a transofmable object. This makes 3D transforming operations
 * transparent indipendently form the type of object that is being transformed,
 * and also hierarchy transformation very straightforward.
 *
 * In fact when you call the scale() method of a 3D object the object just
 * delegates the call to it's primitives(Segments or Triangles) from which it is
 * composed, which delegates the real transformation to Vertex primitives.
